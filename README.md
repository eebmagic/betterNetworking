Python scripts that use a .json file of all your computers to make ssh, scp, and arp easier to use without memorizing IP addresses

I would recomend making aliases to each of the .py files for easy use. Additionally you'll have to edit the JSON_PATH variable in each script to point to the desired location for your file.
