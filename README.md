Python scripts that use a .json file of all your computers to make ssh, scp, and arp easier to use without memorizing IP addresses.
This is intended to be a step up from making aliases as the .json file should update based on the MAC addresses found from arp.

## Usage Guide
The path to the folder of these scripts can be added to your path.
Alternatively you could make aliases to each of the .py scripts.
